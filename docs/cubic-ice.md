The occupancy-pair correlations of an $$8\times8\times8$$ supercell are obtained from a forward Monte Carlo simulation. The first and second nearest neighbors are clearly negative.

The diffuse scattering intensity is calculated over a range of -6 to 6 in each $$h$$-, $$k$$-, and $$l$$-direction with a bin size of 0.04 in each dimension. Averaging is done over 20 independent forward Monte Carlo simulations to improve the statistics. A slice in the $$(h,h,l)$$-plane is also calculated from -4 to 4 along $$(h,h,0)$$ and -6 to 6 along $$(0,0,l)$$.
