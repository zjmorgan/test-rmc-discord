# **Tutorials**

In the examples below, the diffuse scattering patterns without Bragg peaks are generated using a forward Monte Carlo method.

## **Hexagonal examples**
The following introductory examples illustrate refinement each of the three disorder types in two-dimensions.
* [Kagome -- magnetic](kagome-magnetic)
* [Triangular -- occupational](triangular-occupational)
* [Honeycomb -- displacive](honeycomb-displacive)

## **Pyrochlore examples**

Refinement of correlated disorder on the pyrochlore lattice is demonstrated in the following three-dimensional examples.
* [Spin ice](spin-ice)
* [Charge ice](charge-ice)
* [Displacement ice](displacement-ice)

# **Workshop example**

The following example use collected data.

* [Bixbyite -- magnetic](bixbyite-magnetic)
